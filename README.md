I developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can learn and predict outcomes from a nonlinear dataset generated by the Test function: f(x,y)= 3x^2 - 4xy + 2y^2 + 5
The task involves:
1. Generating a nonlinear dataset.
2. Preprocessing the data (splitting, normalizing).
3. Creating an ANN using different optimizers.
4. Reporting performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 values.
5. Performing analysis by varying network parameters such as hidden layers, activation functions, and epochs.
